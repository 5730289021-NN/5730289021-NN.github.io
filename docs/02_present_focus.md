<!-- # Present Focus -->

In addition to my academic work at the university, I am currently exploring two major research problems:

1.	How to enable a humanoid robot to walk smoothly using optimal control theory?
    This involves leveraging optimal control techniques to generate stable, natural, and efficient gait patterns for humanoid robots.

2.	How to make a drifting unicycle perform parallel parking?
    This problem combines trajectory optimization with nonlinear dynamics, aiming to achieve precise and feasible control for a system operating near the limits of traction.
