## 2025
<!-- ### Wellsite Inspection using Quadrupled Robot Platform @ PTTEP -->

### Body Tracking Application
Since FIBO Industry Service acquired Unitree H1 and G1 robots, the team continued to focus on the development and application of humanoid robots. One simple application was to use ORBTEC Femto Bolt along with Azure Body Tracking SDK to transfer operator's joint angles to the robot. I modified existing source code to make it work with the actual G1 humanoid.

### Exploring about Fleet System
To make the robots work collaboratively, I delved further into fleet systems. First, I developed an application to control several robots at once to test the robustness of the communication channel. Then, I utilized the networkx library to instantiate a directional graph for robots to travel step-wise.

### Container Inspection Robot @ PTTGC
Our team continued working on a container inspection robot for PTT Global Chemical (PTTGC). It is used for predictive maintenance by inspecting container thickness. The rover was designed with three wheels for navigating over cylindrical tanks and sphere-shaped vessels. In this project, using ros_control, I devised a new tricycle control strategy, coined the "Energy Shaping Method". The idea was simple: one analog input was used for defining the total energy (i.e., throttle) and another was used for "shaping" the proportion between linear energy and angular energy.

In this project, I also took the opportunity to explore how to "deproject" wheel odometry onto a sphere surface, from which I learned a lot by utilizing the Eigen library.

I also made use of ANN for battery estimation. We used the dataset from electronic load to obtain the SOC time series along with voltage and current profiles. According to the histogram, the error bound is around Â±2%.

### Golf Cart Modification @ YAMAHA
In this project, we provided engineering services to modify an existing golf cart to allow autonomous navigation. The system comprised three main components: a traction drive, steering, and a brake that used a linear actuator. Communication with such a system was not simple; it required a complex state machine, especially for handling communication loss. The system also featured redundant control which made the system robust against computer failure.

### Surveillance Machine Investigating Live Environment (SMILE) Robot @ Siam Paragon
After we accomplished the NECTEC robot, we continued to work on a surveillance robot that operated inside Siam Paragon Shopping Center. The robot was used for measuring PM2.5, detecting water spills, and identifying fire incidents. We added several features on top of the existing ones, e.g., elevator transit module (consisting of point cloud matching and pose controller modules), scheduler module, status manager, media player, etc. With experience from past projects, I managed to establish the FIBO Autonomous Robot (FAR) project. The purpose was to mitigate the problem of deploying the system into new robots with an easy-to-configure process.

## 2023
### Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Robot @ NECTEC
For this project, there was a requirement to create an autonomous programmable mobile manipulator for the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC). The software architecture was divided into three parts: frontend, vision, and ROS, which were under my responsibility. To make it programmable, I employed the concept of behavior trees and integrated it with a Blockly application. As a result, the robot still runs stably at the customer's site.

### Journey & Global Partnership Mobile Robots
After I graduated with my master's degree, I continued working with FIBO Industry as a software supervisor. My first work was to continue integrating fundamental components into mobile robots that were missing in the SOFA robot. These included integration with IMU (using robot_localization), hardware abstraction (using ros_control), and robust navigation (with teb_local_planner). We also collaborated (with Poj) to create the first robot interface using the Android framework.

## 2022
### Completion of An Autonomous Robot for Land Surface Preparation in Salt-Farming Thesis
In this year, I dedicated my time to completing the thesis. I started with mechanical modifications by having my friend (Lerng) weld a steering motor stand and a battery rack. A shop overseer (P' Neng) also helped me create custom couplings as connectors between encoders and actuator shafts. They also gave me advice on integrating the transmission system.

![Front Plate](artifacts/03_master/aris_final/front_plate.jpg){width=250 loading=lazy}

Meanwhile, I developed three circuit boards: one motor controller and two I2C extender boards. The purpose of these I2C extenders was to extend the communication of the encoder that reads steering angle and the current heading. Then, I integrated all components together in a control box which also includes an RTK module, circuit breakers, a contactor, etc. I also managed to crimp and install the connectors using IP67-compliant components.

![Control Box Diagram](artifacts/03_master/aris_final/controller_box_diagram.png){width=300 loading=lazy}

Then, I created two additional pieces of equipment. The first one is an RTK pole. It is used as a base station, sending positional correction signals to the rover. The other is a tripod equipped with a RealSense D435 camera. With the RANSAC algorithm, it can determine surface roughness.

![Encoder Enclosure](artifacts/03_master/aris_final/roughness_measurer.jpeg){width=300 loading=lazy}

Before moving to the real site, I performed an experiment at FIBO parking lot using Marvelmind beacons to measure the localization performance of the GPS/RTK module.

![FIBO Parking Lot](artifacts/03_master/aris_final/field_test_at_fibo.jpeg){width=500 loading=lazy}

![Marvelmind Rover Module](artifacts/03_master/aris_final/marvelmind_rover.jpeg){width=300 loading=lazy}

After the field test at the parking lot was completed, we moved it to the actual salt-farm field to perform real-world scenarios. It turned out that the vehicle could run at an adequate performance level.

![ARIS in action](artifacts/03_master/aris_final/aris_in_action.png){width=300 loading=lazy}

Many people gathered to witness the accomplishment of the vehicle. One of them even asked for two more to be created. The third person from the right was my nephew (R Sarai) who generously lent us the vehicle for modification. In the right photo, I'd like to give credit to my father (left) for the idea of an autonomous clay roller and my grandfather (right) who had been working in the salt-farming industry for decades.

I'd like to express my gratitude to Assoc. Prof. Dr.Djitt Laowattana, Dr. Prakankiat Youngkong and Asst. Prof. Dr. Thawida Maneewan for invaluable advice. Also, I'd like to thank to Agricultural Research Development Agency in Thailand and King Mongkutâs University of Technology Thonburi for funding and promoting my work.

### STM32 Motor Controller Board & Miniature ARIS Robot
To gain readiness before modifying an existing clay roller, I implemented two prototypes for educational purposes: an STM32 motor controller and a miniature version of a clay roller. I learned how to implement position-controlled and velocity-controlled actuators. I also developed skills using shop equipment such as a drill, laser cutter, lathe machine, etc. Consequently, I managed to make a miniature robot move using a joystick.
