Hi, I'm Norawit Nangsue — a Thai–US dual citizen based in Bangkok, Thailand. I specialize in software development, with a passion for building autonomous intelligence to mitigate the world labor shortage crisis and improving people's lives.

With backgrounds in robotics, electrical, and computer engineering, I've worked on a tank inspection robot and a surveillance robot. I enjoy solving complex problems through clean design and practical thinking.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me sketching ideas, solving equations, or reading research papers. I’m always open to new collaborations — especially ones that cross cultures or disciplines.
