<!-- # Present Focus -->

In addition to my academic work at the university, I am currently exploring two research problems:

1.	How to make a humanoid robot to walk intelligently?

    This involves leveraging optimal control techniques to generate stable, natural, and efficient gait patterns.

2.	How to make a drifting unicycle perform parallel parking?

    This problem combines trajectory optimization with nonlinear dynamics, aiming to achieve precise and feasible control for a system operating near the limits of traction.
